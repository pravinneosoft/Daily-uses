What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

Features
Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
Make http requests from node.js
Supports the Promise API
Intercept request and response
Transform request and response data
Cancel requests
Automatic transforms for JSON data
Client side support for protecting against XSRF


Basic Hooks
useState
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.
During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).
The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
